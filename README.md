# UFO Search

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the usefulness of the website we created to search through UFO sighting data.

## Results

The multiple filters created to search through the UFO sighting data allow for very pointed results to be returned quickly and easily. Using the search criteria, one could dig through the data to find all UFO sightings of a certain type, or from a certain location, or on a certain date. By simply inputting their criteria in the provided fields and clicking the 'filter' button, the desired results are returned.
